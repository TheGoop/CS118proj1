struct addrinfo
- used to prep the socket address structures for subsequent use. Itâ€™s also used in host name lookups, 
and service name lookups.

struct sockaddr
- r holds socket address information for many types of sockets
- sa_data contains dest address and port number but is tedious to pack

struct sockaddr_in 
- to deal with sockaddr - we can cast back and forth between this and sockaddr (sockaddr is used for connect)
- in stands for Internet
- used for IPv4
- sin_zero (which is
included to pad the structure to the length of a struct sockaddr) should be set to all zeros with the function
memset()
- sin_family should be set to "AF_INET"

inet_pton()
- converts string ip addr with "." and ":" to struct in_addr based upon format specified
- presentation to network
- note: inet_addr and inet_aton are obsolete and don't work
- returns -1 on error, or 0 if the address is messed up

getaddrinfo() - preparation for launch
- sets up structs we need
-
